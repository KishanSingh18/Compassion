    <string name="Telling_more">Our hearts break for our global Compassion family who have suffered the pain and loss
        caused by COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, economic shutdowns have pushed many more people into
        extreme poverty. In addition to immediate issues, such as droughts and food insecurity, many communities are now
        facing educational challenges caused by school closures and remote learning as well as longer-term medical needs
        complicated by the pandemic. Please continue to pray for those deeply impacted by this pandemic. Our Compassion staff,
        volunteers and frontline church partners across the world are working diligently and creatively to address immediate needs
        and to help vulnerable children and their families rebuild from lasting effects of the pandemic. Thank you for your continued
        support and prayers.</string>
